# Hiring without whiteboards
This is inspired by [Hiring-without-whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards). Yes, I hate typical, Computer-Science based (like: sort, etc) `whiteboard` interviews too.

So, I just want to list real world problems in my company.

# Problems
* How to start your project & deploy it to server ?
* How to access multiple system just with one account ?
* How to organize your web-page OR node-js code ?
* How to specify a user to request limited API at API Level (not just UI Level) ?

# Typical interview
* [Those](http://blog.poetries.top/2017/03/12/front-end-interview-summary/?utm_source=tuicool&utm_medium=referral) are questions in a normal interview
