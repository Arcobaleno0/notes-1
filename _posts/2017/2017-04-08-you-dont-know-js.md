# Up & Going

## Chapter 1: Into Javascript

### typeof a
> Notice how in this snippet the `a` variable holds every different type of value, and that despite appearances, `typeof a` is not asking for the "type of `a`", but rather for the "type of the value currently in `a`." Only values have types in JavaScript; variables are just simple containers for those values.

### Truthy & falsy
> The specific list of "falsy" values in JavaScript is as follows:
>
> * `""` (empty string)
> * `0`, `-0`, `NaN` (invalid `number`)
> * `null`, `undefined`
> * `false`
>
> Any value that's not on this "falsy" list is "truthy."
